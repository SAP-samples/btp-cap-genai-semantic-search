### Advanced Extensions for the Semantic Search Engine

The semantic search can be enhanced in the following ways:

#### 1. Complex Data Testing
Currently, the data model of the CAP application is tailored for testing the semantic search on a single table. This could be extended to more complex tables to ensure a comprehensive search experience. Consider:

- Testing with larger and more intricate data sets.
- Creating and uploading additional tables with more relationships.
- Updating the UI and search logic to handle more complex queries.
- Add more documents with different languages

#### 2. Advanced Search Features
Enhance the search capabilities to allow searching within a specific range of pages or for documents with an exact number of pages. Use the HANA `SCORE` function to find the closest match. Here's an example of scoring logic:

```javascript
const parts = attrMapping.map(item => `Score('${item.include}' in ${item.attribute} LINEAR SCALE 1)`);
return `(${parts.join(' + ')}) / ${attrMapping.length}`;
```

By incorporating these enhancements, the search engine application will be more versatile and provide more accurate results.
