### Advanced Extensions for the Semantic Search Engine

The search engine can be enhanced in the following ways:

#### 1. Complex Data Testing
Currently, the uploaded data set is tailored for testing the semantic search on a single table. This could be extended to more complex tables to ensure a comprehensive search experience. Consider:

- Testing with larger and more intricate data sets.
- Creating and uploading additional tables with more relationships.
- Updating the UI and search logic to handle more complex queries.

#### 2. Advanced Pagination and HANA Functions
To improve the search accuracy and provide a refined user experience, consider implementing advanced pagination and utilizing SAP HANA functions:

- **Pagination:** Implement a procedure to fetch search results page by page.
- **HANA Functions for Closest Matching:** Test the search in your sample data set with the number of pages using the HANA function to generate the distance, so that if you want to search for a document with an exact number of pages, the semantic search engine displays the closest match.

By incorporating these enhancements, the search engine application will be more versatile and provide more accurate results.
